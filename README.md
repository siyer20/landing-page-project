# landing-page-project

This is a personal project that I undertook to practice applying the CSS and HTML I've taught myself over the past week. I copied an example webpage from The Odin Project to the best of my ability. 

I think I did pretty well in regards to getting close to the original image. Maybe I'll come back and customize this a bit-- put in some actual text instead of the filler that's currently there. But that's a later project!
